* Description

  Pragmatic i3 configuration, split to accommodate multiple host systems,
  multiple monitors and a vim-i

  Mapping my workspaces to keys leaning towards right on the keyboard for ease
  of access since I tend to only keep one application per window.

  The colors is based of [[https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery][vim-srcery]], my own colorscheme and I chose a bright
  magenta color for my active window so that I've easily noticeable which one is
  currently active. The rest of the colors chosen are more neutral.

  The config is geared towards multiple monitors and I've assigned specific
  workspaces to their own monitors so that focusing on, say a debugger on a
  secondary screen is a keypress away

  See [[https://github.com/roosta/etc/blob/master/templates/i3/config.i3][config]] and [[https://github.com/roosta/etc/blob/master/templates/i3/variables.i3][variables]] templates for more details.
