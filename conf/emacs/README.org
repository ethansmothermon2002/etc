** Spacemacs inspired emacs configuration

   This is my Emacs configuration. As a vimmer I initially chose
   [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] as my framework around Emacs but have since moved away
   from it, to instead setup my own configuration. I did so as a
   learning experience but I borrow a lot from Spacemacs.

   This configuration is geared toward Arch Linux and I haven't tested
   it on any other OS or distribution.

   The configuration is ATM a work in progress, which I guess it will
   always be but I haven't setup everything I want yet, so language
   support is a bit sparse.

   Currently I got these things set up more or less how I like it.

   - Clojure
   - Common lisp
   - Javascript
   - Markdown / org
   - And various language agnostic utilities like
     + [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]]
     + [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Git]]
     + [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]
     + [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]]
     + [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][Company]]

    I use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]] as building blocks for packages and
    keybindings to vaguely match that of Spacemacs.

** Terminal support

    A focus for this configuration has been that it should work well
    inside a terminal and tmux. See [[https://github.com/roosta/etc/blob/master/conf/emacs/.emacs.d/lisp/init-term.el][init-term.el]] for setup. I
    currently only use Emacs in the terminal despite suggestions
    otherwise.

** Supported Emacs versions

   This config should run on Emacs 24.4 and above but I have yet only
   tested it on the latest Emacs version (26.2). It's quite possible
   various packages break when using older emacs versions.

** Other requirements

   Flycheck linters are required to be installed outside emacs for it
   to work. For javascript you can call:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   make npm-packages
   #+END_SRC

   For clojure I use a combination of [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]] and [[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]] and is
   installed via Arch linux user repository (AUR), see
   [[file:../../aur_packages.txt][aur_packages.txt]] and ~make install-aur-packages~

** Installation

   Easiest way to install this config is to clone the repo:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     git clone https://github.com/roosta/etc
   #+END_SRC

   ~cd~ into repository and call

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   stow emacs -t ~ -d conf
   #+END_SRC

   To link config to home. But I rather recommend that you cherry pick
   whatever you like from this config. It's not really meant to be
   distributed, its my personal config, and it is far from any kind of
   finished state. Not to mention I'm a emacs noob.

** Updates

   To update call git pull in the base ~etc~ folder and in Emacs call ~mx
   package-list-packages~, then ~U~, followed by ~x~

   You should probably restart Emacs after updating so changes can take effect.
