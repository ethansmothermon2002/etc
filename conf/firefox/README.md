ATTENTION: This userChrome is currently outdated, I plan on updating it soon.

Custom
[userChrome.css](https://github.com/roosta/etc/blob/master/conf/firefox/.mozilla/firefox/roosta/chrome/userChrome.css)
styling Firefox using [Srcery](https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery) colors. It
is based on Firefox's dark theme, so that needs to be selected. Symlink this
file to `~/.mozilla/firefox/[user]/chrome/` and restart browser for it to take
effect. A plugin like
[Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) probably
works too.
