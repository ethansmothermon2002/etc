miscellaneous notes
--------
#### Git commit syntax

'@@' =  note/comment

'+++' = generic changes added. Mostly useful in dotfile repo since there.
are changes constantly and im too lazy to add sensible messages to every daily edit.
What I tend to do is add msg for large changes and append that to indicate minor edits.
