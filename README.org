A collection of config files I use on a daily basis on multiple hosts.
My OS of choice is [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]], and my dotfiles are managed by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][Make]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][Stow]].

Companion repos for these dotfiles:
 - [[https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery][roosta/vim-srcery: vim colorscheme]]
 - [[https://github.com/roosta/utils][roosta/utils: collection of various shell utils]]

* Installation
  *Warning*: As with most dotfiles, cherry-picking configs might be a better
  choice than attempting to run the full install steps. There are dragons in
  there.

  First of this repo needs to be cloned, and assuming you are running Arch linux
  calling ~make install~ should in theory setup a fresh system, but I haven't
  tested this rule in a while so it probably needs some attention.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/roosta/etc && cd etc && make install
  #+END_SRC

  git needs to be installed prior to the setup.

* Main Makefile rules
  I list the basics here, there are a bunch of rules and they are in constant
  flux, for details on each see the [[file:Makefile::HOST%20?=%20$(shell%20hostname)][Makefile]].
*** default
    =prerequisites: links update i3 rofi post-install=

    Main rule run on a daily basis. Re-links, updates repos, generate configs.
    This is my goto and my daily routine is pulling any updates, then calling
    ~make~ with no arguments.

*** update
    =prerequisites: update-zsh-plugins update-libs update-spacemacs update-tmux update-vim post-install=

    Runs through the update routine. I keep a bunch of 'lib' repos that isn't
    part of a package manager updated on my system. Located in =~/lib= by default
    and the source for these libs are [[file:lib_repositories.txt::https:/github.com/nonpop/xkblayout-state][lib_repositories.txt]] which is just a flat
    file with the repository URL.

    I made a helper script for this process that either clones a repo or pulls
    if it is already present See the [[file:scripts/git_update.sh::git_clone%20()%20{][git_update.sh]] script for details.

*** links
    =prerequisites link-conf link-misc link-local post-install=

    Links all the config files using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][Stow]]. If you are unfamiliar with stow, have
    a look at the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/][manual]], but the concept is fairly straightforward. All config
    is kept in ~./conf~, and each program gets it's own folder. Contents in this
    folder mirror where you want the config placed with your home(~) as the root.

    So for example, my =.vimrc= I want linked to my home root =~/.vimrc=, so its
    placed in the ~vim~ folder with no additional folder structure inside. Another
    example would be my termite config which should be linked to:
    =~/.config/termite/config= so I mirror that folder structure in
    =conf/termite/.config/termite/config= where =conf/termite= would correspond to
    home root.

*** install
    =prerequisites: user-fs install-pacaur install-packages install-aur-packages save-originals init-spacemacs set-shell clone-source i3 rofi init-tmux links post-install=

    This is the fragile install rule, that sets up a fresh system. It basically
    runs through the lot, and additionally installs packages, and clones various
    repos.

*** min
    =prerequisites: min-install save-originals user-fs update-libs set-shell update-zsh-plugins min-links init-vim init-tmux=

    Setup a minimal system. I use this if I spin up a VM or something and just
    want some basic conf present like vimrc, tmux and etc.
